# otp-middleware
The otp-middleware application proxies requests from OpenTripPlanner UI to API, 
enhancing [OpenTripPlanner](https://www.opentripplanner.org) (OTP) with user
storage, real-time trip monitoring, and more!

## Background
OTP provides multi-modal journey planning, combining transit, biking, walking,
and various car options (e.g., Park & Ride) into complete passenger itineraries.

Transportation agencies might want to extend the functionality of their
trip planner to improve the overall user experience for their OTP implementation.
otp-middleware is a potential way for agencies to fill in those gaps. It provides:

- user management and storage,
- trip monitoring,
- and other features (TODO).
